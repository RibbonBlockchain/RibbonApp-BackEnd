Ribbon Protocol is a universal health coverage rewards and loyalty platform that aims to modify health and wellness behavior through incentivization and rewardable tasks.

The Ribbon App intertwines Universal Basic Income with Universal Health Coverage, utilizing World ID users health & socioeconomic data to enhance global well-being. The protocol rewards users for activities that help assess their wellness and socioeconomic needs, while linking them to equitable UBI and personalized services.

Rewards and Incentives are distributed in points and WLD tokens, on the Optimism Mainnet network which is a Layer 2 network of the Ethereum blockchain.

## Packages

This RibbonProtocol App contains JavaScript tools and applications that enables users to earn tokenized universal basic income. The ribbon app consists of three key components right now; this will change in time. These are as follows:

| [`@ribbonprotoccol/frontend`](https://github.com/RibbonBlockchain/RibbonApp)                   | Frontend NextJS application that users interact with. [Link](https://ribbon-app-ten.vercel.app)                                    |
| [`@ribbonprotoccol/admin-panel`](https://github.com/RibbonBlockchain/RibbonAdminPanelFrontEnd) | Frontend NextJS application for admin management.                                                                              |

Each section has it's own repository and has it's own readme within the package that explains how to set it up and get running with that specific component.

## Requirements

This project requires `node >=18.0.0`, `npm >=10.x.x` and `pnpm >=8.x.x`. A unix shell is also required.

- [Installing Node](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)
- [Installing pnpm](https://pnpm.io/7.x/installation)
- [UNIX Shell (Windows users)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repo and install its dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RibbonBlockchain/RibbonApp-BackEnd.git
cd RibbonApp-BackEnd
pnpm install
```

For development purposes there's a top-level `start:dev` script that will watch and continuously compile all packages concurrently:

```bash
# development
$ pnpm run start

# watch mode
$ pnpm run start:dev

# production mode
$ pnpm run start:prod
```

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to access the API.

For next steps, take a look at documentation for the individual package(s) you want to run and/or develop. Each package can be run from the root directory using pnpm or npm.

## Documentation

To simplify the process of exploring and testing our API, we have created a Postman collection that includes all the endpoints, complete with descriptions, request parameters, and example responses.
You can access the Postman documentation by following this [link](https://www.postman.com/lively-capsule-996856/workspace/ribbon-protocol/collection/11645039-17beb076-c0cf-4af7-b98b-e940738f1747?action=share&creator=11645039).

-  Detailed Endpoints: Each endpoint is documented with detailed descriptions, parameters, and expected responses.
-  Example Requests: Pre-configured example requests to help you quickly understand how to use each endpoint.
-  Environment Setup: Easily configurable environment variables to manage authentication and other settings.
